## Introduction

This repository contains the code and supplementary material for the companion animal pooled analysis study presented in the manuscript "A comprehensive profile of the companion animal gut microbiome integrating reference-based and reference-free methods" by Branck et al. 

## Contents
Custom scripts:
* See "scripts" directory for the code used to generate all main and supplemental figures in the manuscript. A detailed README.txt is provided which contains the input files and output files/figures generated by each script.

Supplemental Tables
* Includes tables describing individual study characteristics and sample information.
* Supplemental Table 1: 	Public and private data sources of cat, dog, and human gut metagenomic samples.								
* Supplemental Table 2: 	By-sample taxonomic profiles generated by MetaPhlAn 4 for all companion animal gut metagenomes								
* Supplemental Table 3: 	By-sample taxonomic profiles generated by MetaPhlAn 4 for HMP1-II baseline (time 0 samples) gut metagenomic samples 																	
* Supplemental Table 4: 	By-sample taxonomic profiles generated by MetaPhlAn 4 for Madagascar cohort gut metagenomes								
* Supplemental Table 5: 	SGB prevalence by host					
* Supplemental Table 6:	Helicobacteraceae spp. distribution across hosts. 							
* Supplemental Table 7: Campylobacter spp. distributed across hosts.								
* Supplemental Table 8: Feature-wise testing (multivariate linear model) for differences in dog gut microbiome, at the SGB-level, based on housing (facility vs. household).
* Supplemental Table 9: Feature-wise testing (multivariate linear model) for differences in gut microbiome, at the SGB-level, across host species (cats, dogs, and humans).								
* Supplemental Table 10: Feature-wise testing for differences in ARGs across host species (cats, dogs, and humans). Multivariate linear models ran with MaAsLin 2 for all samples.
* Supplemental Table 11: Feature-wise testing for differences in ARGs (organized into antibiotic superclasses) across host species (cats, dogs, and humans). Multivariate linear models ran with MaAsLin 2.
